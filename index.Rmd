## Oh, hello...

<center> Welcome to my space!

As told by the name of this website, my name is Kailey.</center>     


## About me      

- I am from Maui, Hawaii (but was also raised in Southern California) 
- I am currently a MPH candidate at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in New York City 
- Go Bruins! I graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles 
- The first place I traveled to outside of the U.S. was Cape Town, South Africa (and I would move there in a heartbeat)
- I find a lot of enjoyment in the little things... (like how close I was to 'pinching' the sun in this picture)
